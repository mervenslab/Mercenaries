# Mercenaries

"It's a story of blood and brethren, no chivalry nor kindness."

</br>

About it :
- A small CLI game, where you will manage a group of mercenaries in a fantasy kind of universe.

Ideas :
- You start as a peon, no skill, no fortune, no stuff.
- You will have the possibility to recruit people.
- Your words and actions have consequences (I want to make an hidden stat system, to handle loyalty from your fellows to you, differents moral caracteristics, omething like that, we'll see where it will lead me).
